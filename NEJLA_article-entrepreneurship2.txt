mostly, when we hear the term entrepreneur, we tend to associate it with a person who has or is starting their own ventures.

an entrepreneur is someone who develops a business model, acquires the necessary physical and human capital to start a new venture, and operationalizes it ans is responsible for its success or failure.

firstly, entrepreneurs have to be an innovator who has game changing ideas.
secondly, they need to have excellent organizationnal and people management skills.
further, they needs to be a leader who can inspire their employees as well as be a visionary. In other words, leadership, values, teambuilding skills and managerial abilities are the key skills they need to have.

needless to say that entrepreneurs are a risk taker.
They put their own money or raises capital from angel investors and venture capitalists which means in case the venture goes belly up, the entrepreneur and investors lose money.
